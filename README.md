Thunderbird Add-On for [OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org/) *built upon* [ThunderbirdTodoist](https://github.com/SmBe19/ThunderbirdTodoist) by Benjamin Schmid (SmBe19)

Not created by, affiliated with, or supported by OpenProject.

## Overview
This plugin adds a button to Thunderbird to add a new task for the selected email. Project and assignee can be set directly when adding a task. It is also possible to add a link to the task which opens the email in Thunderbird.

<!-- ## Installation
To install the add-on, visit the [add-on page](https://addons.thunderbird.net/de/thunderbird/addon/thunderbird-todoist/).

You can also download the xpi file from [here](https://dl.smeanox.com/thunderbird-todoist-0.4.xpi). Open the add-ons page in Thunderbird and choose 'install from file'. -->

### Mail-Links
To support Mail-Links (i.e. direct links from OpenProject to open a mail in Thunderbird), you need to register the protocol in the OS.

Please refer to [ThunderbirdTodoist](https://github.com/SmBe19/ThunderbirdTodoist) for more information.
